//Scenario 10: Recipe Management Application
//Create an abstract class called "Recipe" with abstract methods like "prepareIngredients" and "cook." Implement derived classes like "SoupRecipe" and "DessertRecipe" that provide specific implementations for these abstract methods.

abstract class Recipe{
    
}

public class Task10 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}
