//3. Problem: Develop a student grading system where you have different grading scales for different courses. Use method overloading to calculate the final grade based on the course's grading scale.
//- Example: Create a `Student` class with overloaded `calculateFinalGrade` methods for each course, allowing custom grading logic.

class Student{
    public void calculateFinalGrade(){
        
    }
}

public class Task3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}
