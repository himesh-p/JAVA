//Scenario 1: Vehicle Manufacturing
// In a vehicle manufacturing system, have a base class called "Vehicle" with a method called "manufacture" that handles common manufacturing steps. Implement a derived class called "Car" that overrides the "manufacture" method and uses the super keyword to invoke the base class implementation.

// Scenario 2: Online Retail System
// In an online retail system, create a base class called "Product" with a method called "displayDetails" that shows general product information. Implement derived classes like "ElectronicsProduct" and "ClothingProduct" that override the "displayDetails" method and use the super keyword to display both general and specific product details.
