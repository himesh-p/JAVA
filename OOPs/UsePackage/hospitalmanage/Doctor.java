//Scenario 3: Hospital Management System
// Develop a package called "hospital" that contains classes like "Doctor," "Patient," and "Appointment" that handle various aspects of managing a hospital. Place these classes in the "hospital" package to provide organization and separation from other modules.

package hospitalmanage;


public class Doctor{
    private String name;
    private double fees;
